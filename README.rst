TraitsML
========

TraitsML is a tool for building native user interfaces on top of Traits.
It is a declarative language based on Python, analogous to Qt's QML.
TraitsML currently supports Qt as a backend via PySide,
but it is not tied to a single widget toolkit. 

Prerequisites
-------------
* Traits
* PySide
* PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), for parsing *.tml* files
* Python 2.6
* The "kitchen sink" example requires Chaco
