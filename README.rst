========

TraitsML is like Qt's QML for Traits: a declarative language for building user interfaces with native widgets.
It's based on Python and currently supports Qt as a backend, via the PySide bindings.

Prerequisites
-------------
* Traits
* PySide
* PLY (Python Lex-Yacc), for parsing *.tml* files
* Python 2.6
* The "kitchen sink" example requires Chaco
