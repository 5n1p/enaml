TraitsML
========

TraitsML is a tool for building native user interfaces on top of Traits.
It is a declarative language based on Python, analogous to Qt's QML.
TraitsML currently supports Qt as a backend via PySide,
but it is not tied to a single widget toolkit. 

Prerequisites
-------------
* `Traits <https://github.com/enthought/traits>`_
* `PySide <http://www.pyside.org/>`_
* `PLY <http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/>`_ (Python Lex-Yacc),
  for parsing *.tml* files
* `Python <http://python.org/>`_ 2.6
* The "kitchen sink" example requires 
  `Chaco <https://github.com/enthought/chaco>`_
